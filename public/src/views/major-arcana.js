            <p>
                Not all Tarot cards hold equal importance.
                Some are steeped in deep symbolic meaning and reflect the most fundamental forces of nature.
                These are the Major Arcana cards.
            </p>
            <p>
                More of these cards in a reading indicates more urgency.
                Take seriously the messages these cards give you in proportion to how many there are.
